The first thing I need to do is pick 3 countries from gapminder.txt and select all data for those countries

```{r}
gapminder <- read.delim("gapminder.txt")
countries <- subset(gapminder, country == "Afghanistan" | country == "Albania" | country == "Egypt")
levels(gapminder$country)
```

Use ggplot to make three scatter plots (one for each country) that has year on the x-axis and GDP on the y axis. Describe any trends you see for each country.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("reshape2")
library(reshape2)
ggplot(countries, aes(year, gdpPercap, color=country)) + geom_point()
```
